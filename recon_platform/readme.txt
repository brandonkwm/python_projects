this is an attempt at a reconciliation platform where python is the backend and react is used for the frontend

context:
people think that reconciliation is difficult. There are even vendor systems that have a nice interactive UI.

Problem:
organisations do not see the worth in investing and would always use: 
- manual vlookups in excel 
- buy vendor systems but there is still the integration work with vendor systems / annual contract maintenance

Idea:
there is no need to buy any of that. Just running a script to churn results / create a summary of matches/mismatches.

how to use: create a source csv file / destination csv file with headers / some records and run the backend and frontend on venv and follow UI for instructions

WIP / roadmap
- UI for users to interact with data
- Fix the mismatches shown
