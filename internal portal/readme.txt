this is an attempt at an internal workflow / operational platform where the intention is to have:
1. An agentic AI engine
2. Possible low code platform as well for drag / drop workflow builder functionality

context:
people think that reconciliation is difficult. There are even vendor systems that have a nice interactive UI.

Problem:
Low code / no code platforms have touted to be the best way forward but fact of matter is, it is coded in proprietary language / costly 

Idea:
Developing a platform with open source language allowing full customisation. Revenue could come from licensing. The sky is the limit here on this platform.
Potentially having agentic AI to process information / summarise information or the case-story without creating multiple fields / multiple screens for users to click....


WIP / roadmap
- drag and drop configuration workflow module
